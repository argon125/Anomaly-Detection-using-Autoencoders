Feature Extraction and Anomaly Detection Using Different Autoencoders for Modelling Intrusion Detection Systems

Maintaining network security by preventing attacks is essential for a
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Machine learning techniques heavily depend on artificial feature extraction and are highly complex. Autoencoders have shown promising results in reducing the features extracted in the latent layer. This work analyzes the performance of different autoencoder models. It introduces CAAE-DNN: a feature extraction and classification intrusion detection model based on a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE), an attention mechanism, and a deep neural network (DNN). It has also been coupled with correlation-based feature extraction to aid in feature extraction. The model was evaluated on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset and analyzed using cost-sensitive learning (CSL) because of the class imbalance in the dataset. They yield high classification metrics such as accuracy and F1-Score to build an efficient NIDS.

Keywords: Intrusion Detection Systems, Feature Extraction, Attention, Stacked Autoencoders, Convolution Autoencoders.
